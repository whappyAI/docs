### What You'll Need
- **WhatsApp Number ID**: Your business phone number ID from Meta

- **WhatsApp Number ID** from Meta Business Platform
- **Meta Business Account ID**

</Warning>

## Creating Message Templates

WhatsApp requires **approved templates** for starting conversations with leads. You cannot send initial messages without approved templates.

### Adding Templates

1. Go to the **Message Templates** tab
2. Click **"Add Template"**
3. Fill in the template details:
- **Template Name**: Use underscores, no spaces (e.g., `welcome_message`)
- **Language**: Select the language for your template
- **Category**: Choose Utility (for business messages) or Marketing
- **Message**: Write your template text

### Using Parameters

Make templates dynamic with parameters in double curly braces:

```
Hello {{user_name}}, welcome to {{business_name}}!
How can I help you today?
```

**Parameters you can use:**
- `{{user_name}}` - Lead's name
- `{{business_name}}` - Your business name
- `{{budget}}` - Lead's budget (if collected)
- Any custom field from your lead data

### Template Example

**Template Name**: `welcome_message`
**Category**: Utility
**Message**:
```
Hi {{user_name}}! This is {{business_name}}.
I saw you're interested in our services.
What's the best way I can help you today?
```

### Template Approval Process

1. **Submit**: Click "Save Templates" to submit for approval
2. **Review**: Meta reviews your template (usually 24-48 hours)
3. **Status**: Templates show as Pending â†’ Approved or Rejected
4. **Use**: Only approved templates can be used in campaigns

<Tip>
    Create templates that sound natural and provide value. Avoid overly promotional language to increase approval chances.
</Tip>

## Using Templates in Your Funnel

### Selecting Templates

Templates are used in the **starter node** of your conversation funnel:

1. Go to **Campaign â†’ Funnel**
2. Click on the **Start** node (first node in your funnel)
3. Select an **approved template** from the dropdown
4. The template text becomes your welcome message

### Template Preview

When you select a template, you'll see a preview showing exactly what message leads will receive.

## Template Categories

### **Utility Templates**
- For business communications
- Customer service messages
- Appointment confirmations
- Follow-ups

**Example**:
```
Hi {{user_name}}, thanks for your interest in our {{service_type}}.
Let's schedule a quick call to discuss your needs.
```

### **Marketing Templates**
- Promotional content
- Product announcements
- Special offers

**Example**:
```

```

## Best Practices

## Managing Templates

### **Viewing Template Status**
Templates show one of three statuses:
- **ðŸŸ¡ Pending**: Submitted for Meta review
- **ðŸŸ¢ Approved**: Ready to use in campaigns
- **ðŸ”´ Rejected**: Needs revision and resubmission

### **Editing Templates**
- **New templates**: Can be edited before saving
- **Existing templates**: Are read-only once submitted
- **Rejected templates**: Delete and create new ones with revisions

### **Template Limits**
- You can create multiple templates for different scenarios

- Templates are shared across all your campaigns

## Testing Your Integration

### **Connection Test**
Use the "Test Connection" button to verify:

### **Template Testing**
Before going live:
1. Create and get approval for at least one template
2. Set up a simple funnel using the approved template
3. Test with a personal phone number first
4. Verify messages send and receive correctly

## Troubleshooting

### **Connection Issues**
