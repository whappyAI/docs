Cal.com integration allows your WhatsApp AI assistant to automatically book appointments with qualified leads based on your real-time availability. Instead of manual back-and-forth scheduling, leads can book meetings directly through your conversation funnel.

## How It Works

When a lead reaches a **Book Meeting** node in your conversation funnel:

1. **AI checks availability** on your Cal.com calendar in real-time
2. **Offers available time slots** to the lead via WhatsApp
3. **Books the appointment** automatically when the lead selects a time
4. **Sends confirmation** to both you and the lead

This creates a seamless experience where qualified leads can book meetings without leaving the WhatsApp conversation.

## Setting Up Cal.com Integration

### 1. Get Your Cal.com API Key

First, you'll need to generate an API key from your Cal.com account:

1. Log into your [Cal.com account](https://cal.com)
2. Go to **Settings** → **Developer** → **API Keys**
3. Click **"Create New API Key"**
4. Copy the generated API key

<Warning>
    Keep your API key secure. Anyone with this key can access your calendar information and book appointments.
</Warning>

### 2. Configure in Whappy

1. Navigate to **Integrations → Cal.com** in your Whappy dashboard
2. Paste your API key in the **API Key** field
3. Click **Save** to connect your account

Once configured successfully, you'll see a green confirmation message indicating Cal.com is ready to use.

### 3. Prepare Your Cal.com Events

Make sure your Cal.com event types are properly configured:

- **Set as Public**: Events must be publicly bookable
- **Enable Booking**: Ensure booking is allowed for the events you want to use
- **Configure Duration**: Set appropriate meeting lengths (15min, 30min, 1hr, etc.)
- **Set Availability**: Define your available hours and days

<Tip>
    Create specific event types for different types of leads (e.g., "Sales Demo - 30min", "Consultation Call - 45min") to better organize your calendar.
</Tip>

## Using Cal.com in Your Funnel

### Adding Book Meeting Nodes

In your **Campaign → Funnel** builder:

1. Drag a **Book Meeting** node into your conversation flow
2. Configure the node settings:
- **Select Calendar Event**: Choose which Cal.com event type to use
- **Message Text**: Customize what the AI says when offering booking
- **Confirmation Message**: Set what leads see after booking

### Example Funnel Flow

```
Talk Node: "What's your budget for this project?"
↓
Condition Node: Budget > $5,000?
↓ (Yes)
Book Meeting Node: "Great! Let's schedule a call to discuss your project in detail."
↓
Close Node: "Thanks! I've sent you a calendar invite. Looking forward to our call!"
```

### AI Conversation Example

Here's how the booking conversation might look:

**AI**: "Based on your needs, I'd love to schedule a 30-minute consultation call. I have availability this week:"

**AI**: "• Tomorrow (Jan 16) at 2:00 PM"
**AI**: "• Thursday (Jan 18) at 10:00 AM"
**AI**: "• Friday (Jan 19) at 3:30 PM"

**Lead**: "Thursday at 10 AM works for me"

**AI**: "Perfect! I've booked you for Thursday, January 18th at 10:00 AM. You'll receive a calendar invite shortly with the meeting details."

Then use different **Book Meeting** nodes in your funnel based on lead qualification level.
