## Best Practices

### Getting Started
- **Start simple**: Begin with basic automations before adding complexity
- **Test thoroughly**: Always test with sample data before going live
- **Use test leads**: Mark leads as "test" during setup to avoid affecting real data
- **Monitor early**: Check your automations frequently in the first few days

### Workflow Optimization
- **Use filters**: Add Zapier filters to process only relevant leads (e.g., specific budgets, sources)
- **Separate Zaps**: Create different Zaps for different lead sources rather than complex multi-step workflows
- **Error handling**: Set up email notifications for failed Zapier tasks
- **Regular maintenance**: Review and update your Zaps monthly

### Data Quality
- **Validate phone numbers**: Ensure phone numbers include country codes and are properly formatted
- **Keep data consistent**: Use standardized formats for custom fields across all sources
- **Monitor lead quality**: Regularly review leads coming through automation vs. manual entry

<Tip>
    Start with one simple automation (like sending closed leads to your CRM) before building complex multi-step workflows. This helps you understand the data flow and catch any issues early.
</Tip>
