Triggers when a lead successfully books an appointment through your conversation funnel.

**Use cases:**

3. **Copy your unique API Key**

<Warning>
    Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly. This key gives access to your lead data.

## Setting Up Zapier Integration

### Step 1: Create a New Zap

1. **Go to Zapier** and create a new Zap
2. **Choose "Webhooks by Zapier"** as your trigger app
3. **Select "Catch Hook"** as the trigger event

### Step 2: Configure the Webhook

1. **Copy the webhook URL** that Zapier provides
2. **In Whappy**, go to Integrations â†’ Zapier
3. **Configure your webhook URLs** for the events you want to track:

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Appointment Webhook">
        Configure this URL to receive data when leads book appointments:

        ```bash
        POST https://api.whappy.ai/v1/zap/url/appointment
        Headers: X-API-Key: your_api_key_here
        Body: {
        "targetUrl": "https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/your-zapier-url"
    }
        ```
    </Tab>

        Body: {

    }
        ```
    </Tab>

### Step 3: Test Your Connection

Headers: X-API-Key: your_api_key_here
```

**Response codes:**

- Check that your Zap is looking for the right field names
- Remember that JSON fields need to be parsed

**Authentication errors?**
