Connect your Calendly account to let qualified leads book appointments directly through your WhatsApp conversations. The AI will automatically check your availability and handle the booking process.

## How It Works

When leads reach a **Book Meeting** node in your conversation funnel:

1. **AI offers available times** from your Calendly calendar
2. **Lead selects preferred time** via WhatsApp
3. **Meeting is booked automatically**
4. **Both parties receive confirmation**

No more back-and-forth scheduling messages - everything happens seamlessly in the conversation.

## Connecting Your Account

### Requirements
- **Calendly Premium** or higher plan
- Active Calendly account with event types set up

### Connection Steps

1. Go to **Integrations → Calendly** in your Whappy dashboard
2. Click **"Connect Calendly Account"**
3. You'll be redirected to Calendly to authorize the connection
4. Once connected, return to Whappy to see your event types

<Note>
    The connection uses secure OAuth authentication - Whappy never sees your Calendly password.
</Note>

## Managing Event Types

After connecting, you'll see all your active Calendly event types with:

- **Event Name**: The title of your meeting type
- **Duration**: How long the meeting lasts
- **Description**: Details about the meeting (if set)

### Refreshing Event Types

If you create new event types in Calendly or make changes:

1. Go to the **Event Types** tab
2. Click **"Refresh"** to sync the latest events
3. New events will be available in your funnel builder

## Using Calendly in Your Funnel

### Adding Book Meeting Nodes

In your **Campaign → Funnel** builder:

1. Add a **Book Meeting** node to your conversation flow
2. Select which **Calendly event type** to use for booking
3. Customize the message the AI sends when offering appointments
