The Funnel is Whappy's visual conversation flow builder. It allows you to create automated WhatsApp conversation sequences that guide leads through qualification questions and actions like booking meetings.

## How Funnels Work

Your funnel defines the path a conversation takes with each lead. The AI follows this flow, asking questions, evaluating responses, and taking actions based on the logic you've built.

**Flow Structure:**
- **Nodes** represent actions or decisions in the conversation
- **Edges** connect nodes to show the conversation path
- **Conditions** create branching logic based on lead responses
- **Actions** perform tasks like booking meetings or sending data

## Node Types

### Start Node
Every funnel begins with a Start node that sends the initial WhatsApp message.

**Configuration:**
- **WhatsApp Template**: Select an approved template for the first message
- **Preview**: View the template content before sending

<Note>
    WhatsApp requires approved templates for the first message to a contact. Configure templates in the Integrations section.
</Note>

**Example Use:**
```
Template: "Hi {{name}}, thanks for your interest in our web design services! I'd love to learn more about your project."
```

### Info Node
Collects specific information from leads during the conversation.

**Configuration:**
- **Information Field**: Choose which data to collect (from Info tab setup)
- **AI Guidance**: The AI naturally asks for this information in conversation

**Available Information Types:**
- **Text**: Open-ended responses (company name, project description)
- **Number**: Numeric values (budget, timeline, employee count)
- **Multiple Choice**: Predefined options (priority level, industry type)

**Example Use:**
```
Field: Budget Range
AI asks: "What budget range are you working with for this project?"
Stores: Lead's budget response for later use
```

### Condition Node
Creates branching logic based on collected information.

**Configuration:**
- **Check Field**: Select which information to evaluate
- **Operator**: How to compare the value (equals, greater than, contains, etc.)
- **Value**: What to compare against
- **Default Path**: Where to go if information is unknown

**Available Operators:**
- **Text**: Equals, Contains, Is empty, Is not empty
- **Numbers**: Equals, Greater than, Less than, Greater/Less or equal
- **Multiple Choice**: Equals, Is in list, Is not in list

**Example Use:**
```
Condition: Budget > 5000
True Path: → Book Meeting Node
False Path: → Info Node (ask about timeline)
Default: → True Path (if budget unknown)
```

### Talk Node
Provides information or responses to leads without collecting data.

**Configuration:**
- **AI Examples**: Add examples of what the AI should say
- **Multiple Examples**: AI uses these as guidelines for natural responses

**Example Use:**
```
Examples:
- "We specialize in modern, mobile-responsive websites for small businesses"
- "Our typical project includes design, development, and basic SEO optimization"
- "We can have your site live within 4-6 weeks of project start"
```

### Book Meeting Node
Schedules appointments with qualified leads.

**Configuration:**
- **Meeting Type**: Select from your Calendly/Cal.com event types
- **Event Description**: What kind of meeting this is
- **Ask Message**: Example of how AI should propose the meeting

**Requirements:**
- Calendly or Cal.com integration must be configured
- At least one active event type available

**Example Use:**
```
Meeting Type: "30-min Discovery Call"
Description: "Strategy session to discuss your web design needs"
Ask Message: "I'd love to schedule a quick call to discuss your project. Are you available next week?"
```

### Close Node
Ends the conversation and optionally sends lead data to external systems.

**Configuration:**
- **Webhook (Optional)**: Send lead data to your CRM or other tools
- **Endpoint URL**: Where to send the data
- **HTTP Method**: POST, PUT, or PATCH
- **Custom Headers**: Authentication or content type headers

**Example Use:**
```
Webhook: https://your-crm.com/api/leads
Method: POST
Headers: Authorization: Bearer your-token
Data: All collected lead information sent as JSON
```

## Building Your Funnel

### Getting Started
1. **Start with Context**: Set up your campaign context first (Info tab)
2. **Define Information**: Configure what data to collect (Info tab)
3. **Build the Flow**: Use the visual builder to create your conversation path
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Use the Test button to simulate conversations

### Adding Nodes
- Click the **+** button after any node to add the next step
- **Condition nodes** show two + buttons (True/False paths)
- **Other nodes** show one + button for the next step

### Connecting Logic
1. **Linear Flow**: Start → Info → Info → Book Meeting → Close
2. **Branching Flow**: Start → Info → Condition → Different paths based on response
3. **Complex Flow**: Multiple conditions and paths based on various criteria

### Visual Layout
- Nodes are positioned automatically based on the flow
- **Condition branches** spread horizontally (True left, False right)
- **Linear nodes** flow vertically down the page

## Testing Your Funnel

### Test Button
The Test button simulates a conversation with your funnel:
- **Requirements**: Funnel must be saved and have at least 2 nodes
- **Simulation**: Chat interface shows how the AI will respond
- **Data Collection**: See what information gets collected
- **Flow Paths**: Test different conversation branches

### Test Scenarios
Test these common scenarios:
- **Happy Path**: Lead provides all information and books meeting
- **Incomplete Info**: Lead skips questions or provides unclear answers
- **Disqualified Lead**: Lead doesn't meet your criteria
- **Different Conditions**: Various budget ranges, timelines, or other factors

## Best Practices

### Flow Design
- **Keep it Simple**: Start with basic flows, add complexity gradually
- **Limit Conditions**: Too many branches make flows hard to manage
- **Test Frequently**: Check each change with the test feature
- **Plan Paths**: Map out your ideal conversation before building

### Information Collection
- **Essential First**: Collect the most important qualifying information early
- **Natural Order**: Ask questions in a logical sequence
- **Clear Options**: For multiple choice, make options distinct and clear
- **Default Paths**: Always set appropriate defaults for unknown information

### Meeting Booking
- **Qualify First**: Only offer meetings to qualified leads
- **Clear Purpose**: Explain what the meeting will cover
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Use calendar integration for easy booking
- **Confirmation**: Set up email confirmations through your calendar tool

### Webhook Integration
- **Test Endpoints**: Verify your webhook URLs work before going live
- **Authentication**: Use proper headers for secure API access
- **Error Handling**: Your endpoint should handle the data format properly
- **Data Mapping**: Plan how Whappy's data maps to your CRM fields

## Common Flow Patterns

### Lead Qualification Flow
```
Start → Get Budget → Budget Condition → Get Timeline → Book Meeting → Close
                            ↓
                    Talk (Explain Pricing) → Close
```

### Information Gathering Flow
```
Start → Get Company → Get Industry → Get Size → Condition (Size > 50) → Book Meeting
                                                        ↓
                                              Talk (SMB Services) → Close
```

### Multi-Stage Qualification
```
Start → Get Budget → Budget OK? → Get Timeline → Timeline OK? → Book Meeting
           ↓             ↓              ↓            ↓
        Close         Close          Close        Close
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Test Button Disabled**: Save your funnel and ensure it has multiple nodes
- **Template Errors**: Check WhatsApp integration and template approval status
- **Booking Failures**: Verify Calendly/Cal.com connection and active event types
- **Webhook Issues**: Test your endpoint URL and authentication headers

### Flow Problems
- **Dead Ends**: Every path should eventually reach a Close node
- **Missing Conditions**: Ensure all condition branches are connected
- **Unclear Logic**: Review condition operators and values
- **Too Complex**: Simplify flows that have too many branches

## Next Steps

After building your funnel:
1. **Configure Options**: Set operating hours and timezone
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Try multiple conversation scenarios
3. **Launch Campaign**: Start your automated conversations
4. **Monitor Performance**: Review conversation data and optimize

<Tip>
    Start with a simple linear flow (Start → Info → Book Meeting → Close) and add complexity as you learn what works best for your leads.
