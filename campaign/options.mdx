The Options tab controls **when** your WhatsApp campaign is active and sending messages to leads. This ensures you only contact prospects during appropriate business hours and respects different time zones.

## Campaign Timezone

Set the timezone for your campaign operations.

**How it works:**
- All operating hours are based on this timezone
- Choose the timezone where your business operates
- Leads will receive messages according to this schedule, regardless of their location

**Example:**
```
Business in New York → Select "America/New_York (EST/EDT)"
Business in London → Select "Europe/London (GMT/BST)"
Business in Sydney → Select "Australia/Sydney (AEST/AEDT)"
```

<Note>
    The timezone affects when messages are sent, not the content. Choose your business timezone, not your leads' timezones.
</Note>

## Operating Hours

Configure which days and times your campaign sends messages.

### Day Selection
**Enable/Disable Days:**
- Toggle each day on/off using the checkbox
- Disabled days = no messages sent
- Enabled days = messages sent during specified hours

**Typical Schedules:**
- **Business Days Only**: Monday-Friday enabled, weekends disabled
- **Full Week**: All days enabled with different weekend hours
- **Custom**: Any combination based on your business needs

### Time Ranges
**Set Hours for Each Day:**
- **Start Time**: When to begin sending messages
- **End Time**: When to stop sending messages
- Times are in 24-hour format (9:00 = 9 AM, 17:00 = 5 PM)

**Example Schedules:**

**Standard Business Hours:**
```
Monday-Friday: 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM
Saturday-Sunday: Disabled
```

**Extended Hours:**
```
Monday-Friday: 8:00 AM to 7:00 PM
Saturday: 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM
Sunday: Disabled
```

**International Business:**
```
Monday-Friday: 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM
Saturday-Sunday: 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM
```

## How Operating Hours Work

### Message Timing
- **During Hours**: Messages sent immediately when leads respond
- **Outside Hours**: Messages queued until next operating period
- **Conversations**: Ongoing chats pause when hours end, resume when they begin

### Lead Experience
- Leads receive natural response times during your business hours
- No messages sent late at night or on disabled days
- Conversations feel professional and respectful

### Queue Management
- Messages queued outside hours are sent when operations resume
- Order preserved for fair lead handling
- No messages lost due to timing restrictions

## Best Practices

### Timezone Selection
- **Match Your Location**: Use your business's primary timezone
- **Be Consistent**: Don't change timezone frequently once set
- **Consider Coverage**: If serving multiple zones, choose your main office time

### Operating Hours
- **Respect Boundaries**: Don't send messages too early or late
- **Match Expectations**: Align with when leads expect business contact
- **Test Different Hours**: Monitor response rates at different times
- **Cultural Awareness**: Consider local business customs in your market

### Schedule Planning
- **Start Conservative**: Begin with standard business hours
- **Expand Gradually**: Add hours based on response patterns
- **Monitor Performance**: Track when leads are most responsive
- **Adjust Seasonally**: Different hours may work better at different times of year

- **Existing Conversations**: Ongoing chats follow the new schedule

### Technical Details
- Hours are inclusive (9:00 AM start means messages can send at 9:00 AM)
- End times are exclusive (5:00 PM end means last message at 4:59 PM)
- System processes queued messages within minutes of hours beginning

<Warning>
    Changing timezone affects all scheduled messages. Be careful when adjusting timezone for active campaigns.
