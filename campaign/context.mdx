Campaign Context is the foundation of your WhatsApp automation. This is where you define who your AI assistant is and what it's trying to achieve in conversations with leads.

## Setting Up Your Context

Navigate to **Campaign â†’ Context** to configure these essential details:

### WhatsApp Name
This is the name that appears on your lead's phone when they receive messages.

**Examples:**
- `Sarah from TechCorp`
- `Mike - Web Design`
- `+1-555-0123` (your business number)
- `Lisa | Marketing Agency`

<Note>
    This name shows up in the lead's WhatsApp contact list, so make it professional and recognizable.
</Note>

### Business Activity
Describe what your business does so the AI understands your industry and services.

**Examples:**
- `We provide web design and development services for small businesses`
- `Digital marketing agency specializing in Facebook and Google ads`
- `Real estate agent helping first-time home buyers in Austin, Texas`
- `Business consultant for e-commerce companies looking to scale`

### Conversation Objective
Tell the AI what you want to accomplish in these conversations.

**Examples:**
- `Qualify leads for our web design services and book discovery calls`
- `Find out their marketing budget and schedule strategy sessions`
- `Understand their home buying needs and arrange property viewings`
- `Assess their business challenges and offer consultation packages`

### Additional Information *(Optional)*
Any extra context that helps the AI have better conversations.

**Examples:**
- `We work with budgets starting from $5,000. Focus on clients in the US and Canada`
- `Our typical project timeline is 4-8 weeks. We specialize in Shopify stores`
- `I've been in real estate for 10 years and focus on properties under $500K`

## How the AI Uses This Information

### **Conversation Style**
The AI uses your business context to speak appropriately for your industry and maintain a consistent personality throughout conversations.

### **Qualification Questions**
Based on your objectives, the AI knows what information to collect and how to steer conversations toward your goals.

### **Natural Responses**
The additional information helps the AI answer common questions about your services, pricing, and process naturally.

## Best Practices

### **WhatsApp Name**
- **Keep it personal**: Use a real name when possible
- **Add context**: Include your business or role if helpful
- **Stay professional**: Avoid nicknames or casual language
- **Be consistent**: Use the same name across all communications

### **Business Description**
- **Be specific**: "Web design" is better than "technology services"
- **Include your niche**: Mention your specialty or target market
- **Keep it conversational**: Write how you'd explain it to a friend
- **Focus on benefits**: What problems do you solve?

### **Conversation Goals**
- **Be clear about the outcome**: What happens when qualification is successful?
- **Include next steps**: Mention calls, meetings, or demos you want to book
- **Set expectations**: What level of interest or budget you're looking for

### **Additional Context**
- **Mention typical budgets**: Helps AI qualify leads appropriately
- **Include timelines**: When do projects usually start or complete?
- **Add geographic focus**: If you serve specific locations
- **Note key differentiators**: What makes you unique?

## Testing Your Context

After setting up your context:

1. **Review for clarity**: Does each field clearly explain your business?
2. **Check the tone**: Does it match how you normally communicate?
3. **Consider lead perspective**: Would this make sense to someone unfamiliar with your business?
4. **Test with others**: Have colleagues review for clarity and professionalism

## Next Steps

Once your context is set up:
- Define what **information to collect** from leads in the Info section
- Build your **conversation flow** in the Funnel builder
- Configure your **operating hours** in Options

Your campaign context provides the foundation for all AI conversations, so take time to make it clear and comprehensive!

<Tip>
    You can update your context anytime, but changes will only apply to new conversations. Existing conversations continue with the original context.
