Whappy is a WhatsApp automation platform that helps businesses qualify leads and book appointments through intelligent conversations. Instead of manually messaging each prospect, Whappy's AI assistant handles the initial conversations, asks the right questions, and schedules meetings with qualified leadsâ€”all through WhatsApp.

The platform is designed for businesses that want to automate their lead qualification process without losing the personal touch of one-on-one conversations. Whether you're a consultant, agency, or service provider, Whappy enables you to scale your outreach while maintaining quality interactions with potential clients.

## How Whappy Works

Whappy automates WhatsApp conversations through campaigns that you design. You create a conversation flow that guides leads through qualification questions, and the AI handles the messaging based on your instructions.

The process is straightforward:
1. **Create a campaign** with your business context and conversation objectives
2. **Define what information** you want to collect from leads (budget, timeline, needs, etc.)
3. **Build a conversation funnel** using visual nodes that determine how the AI responds
4. **Connect your WhatsApp Business account** to send and receive messages
5. **Add leads** to your campaign and let the AI qualify them automatically

When a lead receives a message, the AI engages them in natural conversation, asks qualifying questions, and can even book appointments directly through your calendar integration. You receive notifications when leads are qualified and ready for follow-up.

## Key Benefits

**Automated Lead Qualification**: The AI asks the right questions to determine if prospects are a good fit for your business, saving you time on unqualified leads.

**24/7 Availability**: Your AI assistant works around the clock, engaging leads in different time zones and responding instantly to inquiries.

**Personal Touch**: Conversations happen through WhatsApp, which feels more personal than email or forms, leading to higher engagement rates.

**Appointment Booking**: Qualified leads can book meetings directly through the conversation, eliminating back-and-forth scheduling messages.

**Scalable Outreach**: Handle hundreds of conversations simultaneously without additional staff or manual effort.

**Easy Setup**: No coding required. Use the visual campaign builder to create sophisticated conversation flows in minutes.

Whappy bridges the gap between personal outreach and scalable automation, helping businesses grow their pipeline while maintaining the quality of their lead qualification process.
